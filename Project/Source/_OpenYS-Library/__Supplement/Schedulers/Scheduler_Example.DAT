REM This is an example Scheduler.
REM ALL schedualers must be in the Schedulers folder with the file name "Sched*.Dat"
REM As you can see, it uses a specific date time format
REM The datetime is then followed by a TAB ("\t")
REM Then you enter the chat message or command you want the schedueler to implement.
REM OLD Schedulers are IGNORED.
20150101(00:00:00)	This is an old schedueler that will be ignored (schedueled for 1st of January 2015).
20141231(00:00:00)	Schedulers do NOT have to be in order.
20141231(00:00:00)	Schedulers can be set to run at the exact same time as each other.
20141369(00:00:00)	Schedulers will break and not load if the datetime is invalid, so always check your datetime provided is correct.
REM remarks can come anywhere in the file.
REM The correct datetime format is: YYYYMMDD(hh:mm:ss)
REM if you are using a single digit hour,month,day etc, make it a DOUBLE digit number!
REM ie: 201511(0:0:0) is NOT a valid date time, but 20150101(00:00:00) IS a valid datetime.
REM Any questions, come see OfficerFlake on YSFHQ!
REM happy schedualing!
