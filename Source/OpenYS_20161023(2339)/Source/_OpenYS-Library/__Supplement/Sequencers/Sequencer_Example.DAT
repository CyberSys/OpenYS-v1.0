REM This is an example Sequencer
REM ALL Sequencers must be in the Sequencers folder with the file name "Seq*.Dat"
REM As you can see, it does NOT use a datetime, unlike the schedueler!
REM Sequencers no longer automatically LOOP back to the start! user "/sequencer.restart" to do this!

/Sequencer.Stop
REM This abandons this sequencer. It cannot be restarted later on... This example file will not have any effect on the server.

/Say This is an example sequencer - look at the Sequencer folder for more information on sequencers and to remove this sequencer message!
REM You should never see the above message, because the sequencer is stopped above.
REM Delete the line to remove that message,
REM or rename this sequencer file so it no longer follows the sequencer file rules
REM in order to stop that message coming up!

REM remarks can come anywhere in the file. (but you already knew that!)
REM Any questions, come see OfficerFlake on YSFHQ!
REM happy sequencing!
