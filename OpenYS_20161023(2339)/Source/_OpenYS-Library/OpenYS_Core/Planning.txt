>countdown timer
>ability to spawn ground objects
>implement ground combat (PVE)
>implement motion paths and grounds movement
>Novelty features:
-Lightning (Old Orb Feature)
-DiscoLighting(Old Orb Feature) //??? fixed...
-StrobeLighting(Old Orb Feature)
-MiniGames(CTF/AAM Avoidance/Limbo/Conquest(BF3 Style)/Rush(BF3 Style)
-Teleportation (TP to xyz, TP to user...)
-Black Holes (Set's wind towards a single location based on where the player is)
-Warps (Fly into a warp area to quickly jump across the map to another location)
-Aircraft Repair Hangers - tested, possible!


X >Racing (would use a silent checkpoint based system... perhaps even load MotionPaths from the YSF map?
X >Fireworks (Launch a single flare upwards, then create a flare star a few seconds later? should be do-able...)
X >Regular server announcements.
X >Aerial Refueling (I need to work out how to set the fuel from AIRPCMND - should be do-able...) DONE. ^_^
x >Fire Bombs/Rockets/AAM etc. from guns
X >Replay loader/player
X >IRC support
X >Tabled Settings



CHANGES REQUIRED FOR PVE:
=========================
World:
    Aircraft : Vehicle
		-Metadata
		-DatFile
	Ground : Vehicle
		-Metadata
		-DatFilePath

Meta:
	DatFile
		-as string list in memory.
		-class of data: identify = str, nosegear = position...

Vehicle:
	-SendUpdate

Core:
	-get closest aircraft
		-by aircraft position as point, min distance to line drawn by turret vector.
	-move turret towards vector
		-calculate x angle between vectors
		-calc y angle between vectors
		-turrent angle adj. pro-rata based off turn limits.
	-get next point
		-next in list for path
	-move towards point
		-get. current velocity vector
		-get desired directional vector by using vehicle point / destination point.
		-set direction vector by acceleration limit scalar.
		-add the two vectors.
		-limit new velocity scalar by velocity limit.
		-calculate pro-rata change based on new velocity and previous position
		-update position
		-attitude = current velocity vector
	-check if at point
		-if within 2 x accel. limit distance of P, then true,and update target point.
